Topic Name: Desktop Voice Assistant

We have planned to make a desktop voice assistant. Basically We'll start the software implementation with designing UML diagram, Listing out the Functional and Non-Functional requirements, and other related concepts.

For a front -end we'll be implementing GUI and Backend will be sqlite DB.
Some notable features are..
1. We'll implement GUI for login in to voice assistent
- Once a user logins the data will be stored in sqlite DB
2. We'll add  commands such that user can handle any desktop applications easily through voice commands.
- And all the browsed history ( commands history) will be saved in another table of DB

3. If the new user wants to access our application, He can with some sign in credentials 
- These credentials will also be saved in our DB 

*4. additionally, We'll implement a touch mic, like we see in Google.
- such that whenever mic is clicked the user can say in the commands.
 
For over all implementation we'll be using Python Programming Language, and with some of its fascinating/powerfull packages namely pyttsx3, gtts, PyGame, Pyinstaller, sqlite3 and many more...

We'll make a complete application look professional and easy to use.

Thank You...!
