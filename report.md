Topic Name: "Desktop Voice Assistant"

We have implemented a desktop voice assistant. Basically We have started the software implementation with designing UML diagram, Listing out the Functional and Non-Functional requirements, and other related concepts.

For a front-end we've used GUI and Backend- sqlite DB & csv. Some notable features are..

1.We have implemented GUI for login in to voice assistent

2.Once a user logins the data will be stored in sqlite DB

3.We'll add commands such that user can handle any desktop applications easily through voice commands.
  And all the browsed history ( commands history) will be saved in CSV file ( To demonstrate CSV & Pandas)
  
4.If the new user wants to access our application, He can with some sign in credentials
  These credentials will also be saved in our DB.
  
5.Additionally, We've implemented a touch mic, like we see in Google, such that whenever mic is clicked the user can say in the commands.

For over all implementation we've used Python Programming Language, and with some of its fascinating/powerfull packages namely pyttsx3, gtts, PyGame,Pandas, sqlite3 and many more...

We've tried to make a complete application look professional and easy to use.
